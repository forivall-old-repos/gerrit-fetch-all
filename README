A shell script to fetch all changesets from Gerrit

This script allows to fetch all (open and closed)
changesets from Gerrit. This can be useful for
doing offline code review without access to
the Gerit web interface, or to comparing 
differrent submitted changesets.


Gerrit allows you to fetch individual changes into
the git repository like this:

git fetch https://review.openstack.org/p/openstack-ci/git-review refs/changes/84/5784/2
git checkout FETCH_HEAD

This script fetches list of all "refs/changes/*" 
references from gerrit and then downloads them.

For every patchset a branch will be created called

change/5784/2

where 5784 is Gerrit changeset number and 2 is
current patchset number.

You can then compare changesets with a simple

git diff change/5784/2 change/5784/3

(if they have the same parent)

You should invoke the script giving it the name
of the git "remote" that identifies the Gerrit
instance the you fetch from:

  gerrit-fetch-all gerrit

If no parameters are given, "review" is assumed default.
